# Developer Roadmap

Welcome to the Developer Roadmap project! This repository is designed to help developers expand their knowledge, set clear goals for their career progression, and gain a solid understanding of essential tools used across various programming languages.

## Project Objectives

1. Provide a comprehensive roadmap for developers to enhance their skills
2. Offer guidance on career progression in software development
3. Explain the fundamentals of crucial development tools (Git, Jenkins, Linux)
4. Cover multiple programming languages to cater to a wide range of developers

## Current Focus

We're currently building out the Java section, which includes:

- Java developer skills overview
- REST API concepts and best practices
- Detailed explanations of HTTP methods

## Upcoming Sections

We plan to expand the roadmap to include:

- JavaScript
- Python

## Repository Structure

- `java_developer_skills.md`: Comprehensive list of skills for Java developers
- `rest-api/`: Detailed information about REST API concepts and implementation
- `README.md`: Project overview and navigation guide

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start by reviewing the skills list for your primary programming language
2. Dive into specific topics like REST API to deepen your understanding
3. Explore the fundamentals of development tools as you progress
4. Check back regularly for updates and new language sections

We encourage contributions and feedback to make this roadmap as helpful as possible for developers at all stages of their careers.
